Media Queries
The CSS provided includes media queries for two different screen sizes:

(max-width: 375px) and (max-width: 760px): The styles inside these media queries apply to devices with a maximum width of 375px and 760px, respectively. These styles are meant for smaller screens, such as smartphones and smaller tablets.

(min-width: 1440px) and (min-width: 777px): The styles inside these media queries apply to devices with a minimum width of 1440px and 777px, respectively. These styles are meant for larger screens, such as desktops and larger tablets.

The media queries ensure that the component's layout and design adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, providing a better user experience.
